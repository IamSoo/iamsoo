### Namaskar! 🙏 
I am a passionate data engineer who studied electronics in bachelors and data science in masters.
I am born and raised in Odisha, a beautiful state in eastern India. I have spent most of my work life in China and Hong Kong.


### Work 💸
I am a Data Engineer and Architect currently focusing on architecting and building services around new bigdata technologies.
I started my career as a full stack Software Engineer working in Java, Oracle, Javascript(the conventional 3 tier :) ) but later moved through different stacks and roles.
My functional domain of focus through out my career has been finance like retail banking, investment banking, trading & open banking. Lately I got amazed and attracted by the volume of IOT data we generate around us and how it impacts our day to day life. Its also more challenging because of its streaming or real time nature. So I joined a electricity and utility company to build a data platform for the uitily of future.

I got fascinated by the evolution of Bigdata while working for an investment bank and made a big odd decision to do a masters degree(MS) which not only taught me the subjects related to the field Data Science but also helped me to learn some tough things in life like real time management(sometimes i was awake for 22 hours a day during college days), to be passionate for the things you want to build, to have determination & show empathy in life.
I belive that life is short and its not all about tags, hashtags, big companies, big brands, cars, luxury homes in social media. Sometimes the reality is completely different. So I do what I really like and mind my own business. I am rarely active in social media.

### Open Source: 👷 
I do work in some open source projects.
I helped my friend to build https://kuulie.com/ from scratch and worked as a scot-free(no pay) CTO. Its maintained by a service company now.


### Interests(Work related):
I like to design, plan and discuss about bigdata stack & the recent trends. Like spark, flink, kafka, hudi etc
