Namaskar! 🙏 
I am a data engineer who studied electronics in bachelors and data science as masters.
I have most of my work life in China and Hong Kong but born and raised beautiful India.


Work 💸
I work as a Senior Data Engineer in TrueLayer.
I started as a Software Engineer working mostly working Java, Oracle, Javascript but later moved through different stack and roles.
I got fascinated by the evolution of Bigdata while working for an investment bank and made a big odd decision to do a masters degree because of imposter syndrome which not only taught me the subjects related to Data Science but also helped me to learn and manage time, do hardwork(22 hours a day on school days),  empathy.
I also understood that life is not all about tags, hashtags, big companies, big brands, cars, homes in social media. The reality sometimes is completely opposite.
So I do what I really like without thinking what others think and do. 
I am rarely active in social media.

Open Source: 👷 
I do work in some open source projects. 
I designed the initial infrastructure of https://kuulie.com/ which my friend owns.
