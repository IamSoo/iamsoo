### Namaskar! 🙏 
I am a data engineer who studied electronics in bachelors and data science in masters.
I am born and raised in Odisha, a beautiful state in eastern India. I have spent most of my work life in China and Hong Kong.


### Work 💸
I am a Data Engineer currently focusing on architecting and building services around new technologies.
I started my career as a full stack Software Engineer working in Java, Oracle, Javascript(the conventional 3 tier :) ) but later moved through different stacks and roles.
My functional domain of focus through out my career has been finance like retail banking, investment banking, trading & open banking.

I got fascinated by the evolution of Bigdata while working for an investment bank and made a big odd decision to do a masters degree(MS) which not only taught me the subjects related to the field Data Science but also helped me to learn time management(sometimes i was awake for 22 hours a day during college days), to be passionate, to have determination & show empathy in life.
I belive that life is short and its not all about tags, hashtags, big companies, big brands, cars, luxury homes in social media. Sometimes the reality is completely different. So I do what I really like and mind my own business. I am rarely active in social media.

### Open Source: 👷 
I do work in some open source projects.
I helped my friend to build https://kuulie.com/ from scratch and worked as a scot-free(no pay) CTO. Its maintained by a service company now.


### Interests(Work related):
I like to design, plan and discuss about bigdata stack & the recent trends. Like spark, flink, kafka, hudi etc
